// The conditional (ternary) operator is just a Dart operator that takes three operands: a condition followed by a question mark (?),
// then an expression to execute if the condition is truthy followed by a colon (:),
// and finally the expression to execute if the condition is falsy.

//Example

import 'dart:io';

void main()
{

  var value=true;
  print(value==true?"True":"False");

}
