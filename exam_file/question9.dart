// Asynchronous operations let a program complete work while waiting for another operation to finish. Here are some common asynchronous operations:
//
// Fetching data over a network.
// Writing to a database.
// Reading data from a file.


//future

// A future (lower case “f”) is an instance of the Future (capitalized “F”) class. A future represents the result of an asynchronous operation, and can have two states:
// uncompleted or completed.

//async

//The async keywords provide a declarative way to define asynchronous functions and use their results.

//await

//An async function runs synchronously until the first await keyword.
// This means within an async function body, all synchronous code before the first await keyword executes immediately.
